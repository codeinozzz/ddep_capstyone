    "\n",
    "You will be working with the **Wine Quality Dataset**, which contains physicochemical measurements of Portuguese \"Vinho Verde\" wines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each wine sample is rated by experts on a quality scale from 3 to 9. Your task is to build a custom multi-layer perceptron (MLP) using PyTorch to classify wines into **three quality categories**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Low Quality**: scores 3-5 (below average wines)\n",
    "- **Medium Quality**: scores 6-7 (average wines)\n",
    "- **High Quality**: scores 8-9 (premium wines)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Check LMS for the last updated instructions.\n",

    "Don't forget to **convert** the actual dataset into a 3-class one.\n",

    "\n",
    "Complete the Jupyter Notebook file named **1.lab.1-wine-quality-mlp.ipynb**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **PyTorch** high-level libraries\n",
    "- Code must be well-commented and clearly organized\n",
    "- Include markdown cells explaining each step and your design decisions\n",
    "- You can use Google Colab and their free-tier GPU\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Reminders\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think before implementing your MLP class** - consider the input/output dimensions, activation functions, and architectural choices carefully\n",
    "\n",
    "**Present well-reasoned conclusions** - your analysis section should demonstrate deep understanding of your model's behavior and performance. **This last section is critical for demonstrating deep understanding.** Discuss:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which features appear most important for wine quality classification?\n",
    "- How well does your model distinguish between the three quality classes?\n",
    "- What challenges did you encounter?\n",
    "- What architectural choices or hyperparameters had the most impact on performance?\n",
    "- Suggestions for improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: All submitted code is code that you must be able to defend (even if AI generated!)."
